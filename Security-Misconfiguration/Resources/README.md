# Security Misconfiguration

Try to reach /robots.txt

From this file you'll know that there's two hidden directories.
The first one contained htpasswd file with root and MD5-hashed password for the /admin page

```
MD5-decrypt("8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3") = "dragon"
```

The final step is go to the `http://$IPADDR/admin` and login using `root:dragon`.
